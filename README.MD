## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://youtu.be/icvxo4iglU0)

PokeShowdown is a Pokemon Battle Simulator created as a final project for my Computer Science A class written purely in Java.

Features:
* Contains all 151 Gen I Pokemon along their actual moves and stats
* Takes into account both Pokemon and their moves' strengths, weaknesses, and stats when calculating damage
* Battle against the computer which takes into account what moves to make and when to tactically swap out

Created by Fletcher Henneman, Diego Urena, and Ethan Kim.

## Getting Started

The executable ```Game.jar``` file will run our game without having to import the project into a Java IDE.
This was developed in the BlueJ IDE.
